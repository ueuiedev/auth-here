    ' The SuspendAndResumeService allows you to save the App data before the App is being suspended (or enters in background state).
    ' In case the App is terminated during suspension, the data is restored during App launch by this ActivationHandler.
    ' In case the App is resumed without being terminated no data should be lost, a resume event is fired that allows you to refresh App data that might
    ' be outdated (e.g data from online feeds)
